    <h1>What We Are</h1>
    <h5 class="padding-32">Phi is a web application that allows you, the user, to generate a
        playlist based on your mood. This is accomplished through the answering of several questions
        asked through our interface.
    </h5>

    <p class="text-grey">These questions that are answered return to the AI a set of values that
        are then compared to our database of songs, provided to us through Spotify. Any songs that meet
        the criteria given are placed into a playlist. Simply log in with your Spotify account and get
        started! *Disclosure: We do not save any account information, all login credentials are stored
        through Spotify.*></p>
